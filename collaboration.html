                    The 2021-2022 FIRST Tech Challenge offered me with the ability to mentor different teams across the United States. 
                    Locally, I have taught classes at NYC FIRST scrimmages and assisted teams with programming concepts like computer vision (like Redhawk Robotics). I have also mentored the Chapin FRC Programming Team to make sure 
                    that they would be ready for the 2021-2022 FRC Season. I've also worked closely with schools that are thinking about creating a FIRST Team (for example, the Heschel School) and have talked to them about the process and some of the information that they may need to know when starting a FIRST Team. 

                    Alongside that, I've volunteered at different FTC events, serving as a robot doctor and fixing their hardware and software issues. For example, at the NYC Qualifier 5, I helped the Regis Owls revive their Control and Expansions Hubs, allowing them to compete in the competition.

                    In order to better improve my work in the Ultro Robotics Team, I have communicated with several professionals in the field. For example, I have talked with Charles Agulla (COO of Invistics), Nate Garcia (Associate Scientist at Pfizer), and Walid Rahman (Data Scientist at VianAI). From each one of these three individuals,  I've come to learn more about different techniques I can apply to my processes. 
                    I also intern at the Weill Cornell MRI Radiology Lab, closely working with professors and PhD-students on medical imaging research. It is from there I have learned a lot more about computer vision, some of which I have applied into the Ultro Robotics Team.
